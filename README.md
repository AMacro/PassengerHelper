## FAQ
### Inspiration for this mod
I started to get a bit annoyed with having to remember to recheck the station boxes on the passenger cars and reverse the direction of the passenger engine everytime the train got to Bryson on my latest save. Thus I originally created this mod to get rid of that annoyance. It has slowly evolved into a pretty decent mod at this point. <b><u>Please note the version. Consider this a BETA until v1.0.0!</u></b>
### What does this mod do?
With minimal input from the user, this mod will recheck stations on the passenger cars and reverse the engine direction when reaching the last station. The last station is defined as when none of the passenger cars have any stops selected.
You select your stations from the Road AI page by clicking the PassengerSettings button.

### Does this work in Multiplayer?
Yes, but not well tested outside of only the host having it and the clients not interacting with the passenger train. Use at your own risk. I hope to have a better understanding of this at a later time.

### What version of Railroader does this mod work with?
2023.5.3

Special thanks and credit to Zamu for creating Railloader.
